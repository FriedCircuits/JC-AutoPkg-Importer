# JumpCloud AutoPkg Importer

![relax and automate your software deployments](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/JC-AutoPkg-Importer/wiki/images/mac-management-transparent.png)

JumpCloud can leverage [AutoPkg](https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg) to automate package testing and deployment through the JumpCloud AutoPkg Importer. Those familiar with AutoPkg can use develop their own .pkg overrides which the JumpCloud AutoPkg Importer can use. To learn more about AutoPkg, visit the [AutoPkg wiki](https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg/wiki) page for documentation. The JumpCloud AutoPkg Importer was designed process AutoPkg packages to distribution points and dynamically create JumpCloud commands to install those package to system targets.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.5.x+
- JumpCloud Tenant
- AutoPkg 2.x+
- awscli
- S3 Storage Bucket to store AutoPkg Packages
- Python Modules installed to AutoPkg's embedded copy of Python
  - JumpCloud APIs V1 and V2
  - Boto3

### Optional Settings

- JumpCloud System Insights

JumpCloud System Insights are required to query systems for application versions. By default AutoPkg JumpCloud recipes can run without System Insights but the real power of patch management and the AutoPkg JumpCloud importer is the ability to edit groups from System Insights data.

## In a nutshell

The JumpCloud Importer takes input from .pkg recipe and uses the JumpCloud API to build a system group & command for deployment to JumpCloud systems.

AutoPkg recipes can be overridden and it's best practice to do just that. Overridden package are generally saved locally and trusted. When the parent recipe changes, AutoPkg should notify you of the change and an admin can inspect the recipe for validity before accepting it's changes. [How (Not) To Do Bad Things With AutoPkg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnvQmLcDF8w)

When creating an override, add the JumpCloud Processor in the Process array of a given recipe. Example recipes are located in the [recipe_overrides](recipe_overrides) directory.

```XML
<key>ParentRecipe</key>
<string>com.github.autopkg.AutoPkgGitMaster</string>
<key>Process</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>Processor</key>
        <string>JumpCloudImporter</string>
        <key>Arguments</key>
        <dict>
            <key>JC_DIST</key>
            <string>AWS</string>
            <key>JC_SYSGROUP</key>
            <string>AutoPkg-%NAME%-%version%</string>
            <key>JC_TYPE</key>
            <string>auto</string>
        </dict>
    </dict>
</array>
```

### Arguments/ Input Variables

The following Arguments/ Input Variables are required for the JumpCloud AutoPkg Processor to complete a successful run.

#### JC_API

The JC_API input variable is the only input variable which is not passed in via the recipe. The API key is set as a key in the com.github.autopkg preference file located at ~/Library/Preferences/com.github.autopkg.plist. The JC_API key can be set as a recipe variable but it seems cumbersome to copy that into each recipe.

After installing the latest version of AutoPKG, add your JumpCloud API key to the AutoPkg:

`defaults write ~/Library/Preferences/com.github.autopkg.plist JC_API yourApiKey`

Note: Your API key is stored on a local system when the above command is used, evaluate whether or not this meets the security requirements of your organization. Receipts for each package are generated by default, those receipts will contain your a copy of your API key unless other specified actions are made.

#### JC_SYSGROUP

This input variable is the name of the smart group built using system insights. In the example above AutoPkg-%NAME%-%version% should build a smart group (and command) with the name of the given software package and version. Ex. AutoPkg-Firefox-72.02

#### JC_USER

This input variable is used when building commands, the id of a command runner may be passed into this variable field. By default the root user account is assigned to the commands built with this processor.

#### JC_TYPE

There are three valid values which can be passed into each the JC_TYPE field:
self, auto or update.

**self**: This type of AutoPkg run builds a group and command based on the JC_SYSGROUP variable. Given that System Insights is required to query systems for applications, a JC_TYPE of self would not invoke System Insights for this task. Manual assignment of systems would be required.

**auto**: This type of AutoPkg run queries systems in your organization and cross references the title and version of applications on systems with the title of software from an AutoPkg recipe. For example running the Firefox recipe would query JumpCloud systems for the following:
Does the system have Firefox?
Is the installed version of Firefox up to date (based on the recipe definition)?

If a system does not have Firefox or if a system has an out-of-date version of Firefox, it would be added to the group. Systems assigned to this group and corresponding command are scheduled to run the command once. After the command runs, the system is removed from the the group.

**update**: This type of AutoPkg run builds a system group (if it does not exist) and only adds systems which currently have the AutoPkg app installed. Those systems who's version of the app are out of data are kept in the system group. This run type can remove systems without the specified app from the system group if the group exists and systems without the group are in that group. Admins who only wish to update systems with an app can use the update type to run app updates.

#### JC_DIST

During the beta development of this processor only "AWS" (Amazon Web Services) can be passed into this field. Other distribution endpoints have not yet been developed.

#### AWS_BUCKET

This is the bucket name required for AWS. the default value is "jcautopkg" if that bucket name does not exist, the processor will fail. The credentials specified in [AWS Distribution Points](#AWS-Distribution-Points) should have access to your AWS Bucket, if the bucket is unreachable the processor will fail.

### Installing the JumpCloud Importer

To install the JumpCloud AutoPkg Importer, first ensure AutoPkg](https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg) is installed. Because AutoPkg contains it's own version of Python, the JumpCloud AutoPkg Importer must be made accessible to that version of Python.

Copy the JumpCloudImporter.py file to `/Library/AutoPkg/autopkglib/` to make the importer available in the AutoPkg context.

After copying the JumpCloudImporter.py file to AutoPkg's python library, follow the remaining steps to ensure AutoPkg can access your S3 bucket and the JumpCloud Python API.

### AutoPKG 2.0+ Dependencies

AutoPkg 2.0+ contains it's own distribution of Python3, the following modules should be installed to the AutoPkg python3 framework as they are out of the scope of the standard python modules. All the modules below are referenced by the JumpCloud AutoPkg Importer during an AutoPkg run, they need to be made available to AutoPkg's distribution of Python3

Install the [JumpCloud Python APIs, v1 and v2](https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/jcapi-python)

```bash
sudo /usr/local/autopkg/python -m pip install git+https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/jcapi-python.git#subdirectory=jcapiv1
sudo /usr/local/autopkg/python -m pip install git+https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/jcapi-python.git#subdirectory=jcapiv2
```

Install the [AWS SKD boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/quickstart.html)

```bash
sudo /usr/local/autopkg/python -m pip install boto3
```

### AWS Distribution Points

Currently, a 1MB file size limit exists for all files on JumpCloud commands, as such AWS S3 buckets are used to store larger files. The JumpCloud AutoPkg Importer uploads packages to an S3 bucket and returned the bucket item's url. The AWS SDK is required to process packages and add AWS objects, the AWS CLI is required to authenticate to S3. By using this software you accept any and all costs associated with Amazon Web Services.

[Install the AWS Cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html):

Setup AWS Credentials:

```bash
aws configure
```

### Bucket configuration

Within your AWS portal, build and name a bucket. Make the bucket accessible to your systems. Before making a bucket public, attempt to run the processor with a recipe and check the output, a .pkg file should be uploaded to s3.

Here's an example public bucket policy for systems public access to GetObject. Create a bucket policy that fits the needs of your organization and security requirements.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicRead",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::jcautopkg/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## JumpCloud Example Recipes

The [recipe_overrides](recipe_overrides) directory contains recipe examples which have been tested to work with the JumpCloud AutoPkg Importer. If you plan to use one of the recipes in this directory, you will likely have to import the parent recipe repositories.

To run one of the recipes in the example directory, simply run:

```bash
autopkg run Firefox.jumpcloud.recipe
```
